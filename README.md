Write a 'calcAverageHumanAge' function as an arrow function, and using chaining!

1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge=2 x dogage, if the dog is > 2 years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge x 4
2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years odl (which is the same as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)

TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
TEST DATA 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
